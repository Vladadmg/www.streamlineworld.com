					<title>L.A. is Amazing</title>
					<link>http://streamlineworld.com/ontheroad.cfm?feature=91880&amp;postid=2667</link>
					<description>Well, we&apos;ve been in L.A.&amp;nbsp;for a few days now and I have to say that it is incredible.&amp;nbsp; The band has gotton so much done and met so many great people out here.&amp;nbsp; It&apos;s really been an awesome experience so far.&amp;nbsp; We&apos;ve been staying with Tank&apos;s sister Kelly and her boyfriend Jeremy right in Santa Monica and they&apos;ve been outstanding to&amp;nbsp;us&amp;nbsp;(we&apos;ve posted some pictures of their apartment and the surrounding area below).&amp;nbsp; We&apos;ve also been meeting with some executives from the music industry and we are very&amp;nbsp;pleased with how the meetings have gone. &amp;nbsp;

Last night we went into the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.4thstreetrecording.com/&quot;&gt;studio to lay down two brand new songs for a demo we&apos;re planning to show to a few labels out here.&amp;nbsp; Our session, which started at midnight and ended at 8 o&apos;clock this morning, went very well.&amp;nbsp; So far the bass, drums and acoustic tracks are finished (thanks again Brian, Derek and Tim for all your help).&amp;nbsp; Some time in the next few days we&apos;ll go back and lay down the electric guitars, keys and vocals.&amp;nbsp; The songs will be finished and posted by next Wednesday at the latest, so keep checking back for those.&amp;nbsp; We think these new songs are our best ones yet and are excited to share them with all of you.&amp;nbsp; We&apos;ve posted some pictures from the&amp;nbsp;session last night below.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;</description>

					<title>Seattle Arrival (Thursday 6/23)</title>
					<link>http://streamlineworld.com/ontheroad.cfm?feature=91880&amp;postid=2175</link>
					<description>Well we finally made it.&amp;nbsp; We arrived in 
Seattle
 around 10:00 a.m. this morning after driving straight through the night from 
Denver
.&amp;nbsp; The trip was long and took almost 20 hours, but we&amp;rsquo;re finally here.&amp;nbsp; We stopped for breakfast about 45 mins outside the city at a pancake house and continued on to Vic&amp;rsquo;s apartment.&amp;nbsp; After getting lost for a little while we arrived at Vic&amp;rsquo;s place, which is really nice.&amp;nbsp; Today we drove around downtown 
Seattle
 and saw the city.&amp;nbsp; We ate lunch at a restaurant on the water and checked out the local 

Guitar
 
Center

.&amp;nbsp; After all this driving I think we&amp;rsquo;ll call it a day early tonight.&amp;nbsp; There&amp;rsquo;s some pics from today further down the page, be sure to check them out.</description>

					<title>Day 2 (Tuesday 6/21)</title>
					<link>http://streamlineworld.com/ontheroad.cfm?feature=91880&amp;postid=2174</link>
					<description>We arrived in 
Denver
 tonight at 8:30 p.m. our time, which would be 10:30 back in 
Rochester
.&amp;nbsp; It&amp;rsquo;s weird driving through these time zones and gaining an hour each day.&amp;nbsp; Anyway, we left the hotel this morning around 10:00 a.m. and hit the road.&amp;nbsp; We are staying with Matt and Emily, Jon&amp;rsquo;s roommates from 

Ithaca
 
College

.&amp;nbsp; They have a really nice apartment right outside the city.&amp;nbsp; Tonight we went to dinner at Champs and then took a tour of the city.&amp;nbsp; Matt works as a physical therapist for the Nuggets, so we drove passed the arena where they play.&amp;nbsp; It was a fun night but we need to rest up because we&amp;rsquo;re planning to drive straight to 
Seattle
 in the morning (a 19 hour drive).&amp;nbsp; We&apos;ll check in when we get to Seattle, but until then check out some of the new pics from today.</description>

					<title>Depature (Monday 6/20)</title>
					<link>http://streamlineworld.com/ontheroad.cfm?feature=91880&amp;postid=2172</link>
					<description>Well we finally did it.&amp;nbsp; At approx. 10:30 this morning the band piled into Jonny&apos;s new van and we headed out for the West Coast.&amp;nbsp; We won&apos;t actually arrive there until Thurs, but the road trip should be a fun part of the experience.&amp;nbsp; Anyway, today we made it as far as 

Iowa City and got a hotel room for the night.&amp;nbsp; We&apos;ve spent less than $80 on gas, tolls and food so far which is pretty surprising considering how far we made it.&amp;nbsp; Along the way, we grabbed dinner at a local mall, which we all agreed was probably the cleanest and nicest looking mall we&amp;rsquo;d ever seen.&amp;nbsp; We also went to see &amp;lsquo;Batman Begins&amp;rsquo;&amp;nbsp;at this mall, mostly because Tank was raving about how good it was (having seen it the night before).&amp;nbsp; Then we hit the road again, arriving in 

Iowa City around 3:30 a.m.
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;There are a few pics further down on this page from the day, be sure to check them out.&amp;nbsp; The ride went fairly smoothly despite the fact that the van was packed to capacity.&amp;nbsp; The single passenger seat left in the back (which is surrounded by gear) is quite a claustrophobic environment, which we nick-named &apos;The Cell&apos;.&amp;nbsp; We each took turns driving and everyone dreaded their turn to inhabit the cell.&amp;nbsp; Tomorrow we will arrive in 

Denver and stay with Jon&amp;rsquo;s old college roommate Matt Fria.&amp;nbsp; We&amp;rsquo;ll check back in then.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;
