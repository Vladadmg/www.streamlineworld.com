					<description>Hey Everyone,
I wanted to give a little update. We&apos;re currently in the process of booking some more shows for July and August, so be sure to check back in the next few days and weeks for more additions to the calendar. We&amp;rsquo;re going to be doing quite a bit of touring these next few months and will hopefully be hitting several states in the process. Alabama, Florida, Tennessee, Iowa, Illinois and Texas are all on the radar, so be sure to check back for the latest updates.

In other booking news we are thrilled to announce that we will be performing with Switchfoot in Little Rock, Arkansas on July 17 at the Riverfest Amphitheater. The show starts around 5:00p.m. and will feature several bands. We&amp;rsquo;re really looking forward to playing with these guys, it should be a great show.

We are also eagerly anticipating our show this Saturday with Gavin DeGraw at Blue Bayou Water Park in Baton Rouge. We&apos;ve been trying to pair with Gavin for a few years now (some of you may remember we shared the same management for a time) and are ecstatic that we are finally able to make it happen in our hometown. It looks like it&apos;s going to be hot (shocking I know) so definitely make use of those park passes during the day (all tickets are combined passes for both the water park and concert).

If you can&apos;t make it out Saturday for the full band show, Brad and I will be playing an acoustic show on Friday night at the Daiquiri Cafe in Brusly (off 1 South) from 10-1. We&amp;rsquo;ll be playing mostly Streamline material, as well as a few other selections and maybe even some new songs. As always drinks are on Scholl the whole night.

Lastly, I wanted to take a minute and talk setlists. You may have noticed as part of our new myspace layout (thanks Katy) we have added a section to post the setlists from our shows. We are constantly trying to improve our live performances and as part of that quest we are striving to never play the same show twice. We want each concert to be a unique experience with something different happening each time. I thought it would be interesting for you all to see what we&amp;rsquo;re playing each night. We always want to hear what your thoughts are, so please feel free to comment, message, text, tweet, call, whatever us with your feedback. Let us know what&amp;rsquo;s on your mind.

Well, that&amp;rsquo;s all I have to say. Hopefully you&amp;rsquo;re all well and we&amp;rsquo;re looking forward to seeing and hearing from you this week. Til then, be excellent to each other.
-Mike

					<title>Streamline News - LYRICS TO NEW CD</title>
					<link>http://streamlineworld.com/newsarchive.cfm?feature=43578&amp;postid=39926</link>
					<description>
LYRICS TO NEW CD
So in an effort to preempt the inevitable bewilderment and resultant bombardment of emails wondering what the hell it is I&apos;m saying in these songs, I have decided to post the lyrics for the new CD. Annunciation has never been one of my strongest suits, so hopefully this will clear up any confusion that can and often does occur whenever I open my mouth to sing. Although it is pretty amusing to hear what people come up with (&amp;quot;far away and long beyond the apple tree&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;you probably wish the bullet had caught my head, but it landed in my butt instead&amp;quot; etc.) I thought you might like to see what I&apos;m actually saying, even if it doesn&apos;t sound like it. Anyway, I hope you like them.

p.s. I don&apos;t have the lyrics for &amp;quot;Anything&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Let Go&amp;quot; on my computer and would feel uncomfortable posting them without first consulting with Brian (the author of those two), but I will see if he wants to post them as well.

Arson &amp;amp; Alchemy

I once believed divine decree
But all the years have poisoned me,
With a flagrant apathy

Oh I never lost control at all,
I just gave into the greatest lie that the world has ever known

I could&amp;rsquo;ve been so much more than I am

Well I&amp;rsquo;m still breathing
though not all I was meant to be yet
Can you heal me alchemy?

Make me a sire of gold
And I&amp;rsquo;ll set fire to the world
Cause I&amp;rsquo;ve got years to burn
before I&amp;rsquo;m gone

I used to fan the flames but now,
I want to be the wind that blows from the hand that wrote it all

I&amp;rsquo;ve been first star wishing
For a Midas Affliction
From Chrysopoeiate addiction
But I&amp;rsquo;m still so far off

I want to be so much more than I am

Well I&amp;rsquo;m still breathing,
Though not all I was meant to be yet
Can you heal me Alchemy?

Make me a sire of gold
And I&amp;rsquo;ll set fire to the world
Cause I&amp;rsquo;ve got years to burn
Before I&amp;rsquo;m gone

Hurricane

You shimmer like the Northern Star and I&amp;rsquo;m just the guy with the telescope on the ground
You&amp;rsquo;re rushing like a waterfall and I&amp;rsquo;m just the dribbling of a faucet that won&amp;rsquo;t turn off
I got concrete shoes, and you&amp;rsquo;re strapped to rockets,
If it&amp;rsquo;s sink or swim, then I&amp;rsquo;m swiftly drowning
I&amp;rsquo;m on the ocean floor and you&amp;rsquo;re out of the atmosphere

Why do I not see this coming?
The more I try, the less you&amp;rsquo;re enamored
When it all plays out, well who was I kidding?
To say you&amp;rsquo;re out of my league doesn&amp;rsquo;t start to explain it
I&amp;rsquo;m a drop of rain and baby you&amp;rsquo;re a hurricane

I whipped out the big guns, aimed to impress,
centered those cross-hairs on your chest
crossed my fingers, pulled the trigger
just hoping for the best
you probably wish the bullet had caught my head
but it landed in my foot instead

Why do I not see this coming?
The more I try, the less you&amp;rsquo;re enamored
When it all plays out, well who was I kidding?
To say you&amp;rsquo;re out of my league is a kind understatement
I&amp;rsquo;m a drop of rain and baby you&amp;rsquo;re a hurricane

Those chemicals made synapses fire,
made illogical seem probable
Like a cannon ball, I&amp;rsquo;m bound to soar and fall
I&amp;rsquo;m just a lead balloon, you&amp;rsquo;re anti-gravitational.
And I&amp;rsquo;m out of my head

Why do I not see this coming?
When the more I try, the less you&amp;rsquo;re enamored
When it all plays out, well who was I kidding?
To say you&amp;rsquo;re out of my league doesn&amp;rsquo;t start to explain it
I&amp;rsquo;m just a drop of rain and baby you&amp;rsquo;re a&amp;hellip;

But if I had what I want, I&amp;rsquo;d get you off and I&amp;rsquo;d turn you on
And I&amp;rsquo;d have what I need, to bring down a goddess to her knees
I&amp;rsquo;d sell my soul to know, what to give to the girl who&amp;rsquo;s got it all
I&amp;rsquo;d conjure the winds to blow and knock you off of that pedestal
I&amp;rsquo;m calling your bluff, and I bet it all so you better fold
If I don&amp;rsquo;t strike gold, what&amp;rsquo;s left to give when you got it all?

Ghost

A single ray of light is dancing in a darkened room
it penetrates an eye close-by, but the black is not removed
the face in which the eye resides is a mix of cloth and stone
a pale linen veil draped over withered bones

She hovers like a moth over the flame,
But it&amp;rsquo;s not the light she needs, only the heat it brings
And as I watch the powder start to change
I know where seven years have gone to waste

I would give the world
To go back all those years
And stop you at the start
before you disappeared

I&amp;rsquo;ll be there for you when I can
just show me there&amp;rsquo;s yet something there
that&amp;rsquo;s still worth fighting for

The world around her is just spinning like a carousel
All attempts to revert back to normalcy have quickly failed
As her immortality is sizzling on a silver spoon
She&amp;rsquo;ll contemplate the point in space and then create the wound

I do not know this solemn ghost
It&amp;rsquo;s not the human I recall
her shell&amp;rsquo;s remained the same
But all the hope in her is gone

I would give the world
To go back all those years
And stop you at the start
before you disappeared

I&amp;rsquo;ll be there for you when I can
just show me there&amp;rsquo;s yet something there
that&amp;rsquo;s still worth fighting for

save me
save me
save me
come on say
save me
save me
save me
and I&amp;rsquo;ll replace the flame

my little ray of light is dancing in a cloud she made
I wish she&amp;rsquo;d come back down where it is safe
And stay

Thick &amp;amp; Thin

In the glow of a street light,
when the night cloaks her shame,
she looks for love and the comfort of a hollow embrace
And though it offers her gold, and brief escape from the cold
She&amp;rsquo;s after something much more than simply warming her bones

She says, &amp;ldquo;a few lays, alleviate the sharp pangs of hunger,
But a heartbeat&amp;rsquo;s still all I have&amp;rdquo;

And she says, &amp;ldquo;I want someone to love me just the way I am, just the way I am&amp;rdquo;
She says, &amp;ldquo;I want someone beside me whether lose or win, through thick and thin&amp;rdquo;

In the blaze of the limelight
To unanimous pride
She outshines every diamond in a starlet&amp;rsquo;s sky
But she&amp;rsquo;s shrouded in darkness like a waning moon
she knows there&amp;rsquo;s much more to her than is seen by the world

She says, &amp;ldquo;I can&amp;rsquo;t find peace of mind when nobody knows me
And a heartthrob is all I am&amp;rdquo;

And she says, &amp;ldquo;I want someone to love me just the way I am, just the way I am&amp;rdquo;
She says, &amp;ldquo;I want someone beside me whether lose or win, oh through thick and thin&amp;rdquo;

&amp;ldquo;When the light fades to night brings the cold rain and thunder
When a desert sun, is burning up every drop of hope there under
Be an anchor in an ocean of change&amp;rdquo;
And she says, &amp;ldquo;I want someone to love me just the way I am, just the way I am&amp;rdquo;

&amp;ldquo;Say to me, come on and say to me
Say you&amp;rsquo;ll love me just the way I am, just the way I am
Stay beside me whether lose or win oh through thick and thin&amp;rdquo;

Navigator
I like the way you look tonight
Wearing only moonlight
You sparked a fire
And I am smoldering
You feign indifference darling,
But I feel you trembling
You&amp;rsquo;re trying so hard
To not be physical
Why even fight it child,
When it&amp;rsquo;s this natural?

When we&amp;rsquo;re all alone and no one needs to know
Without a single light on

Let me be the navigator, and I will guide you
I know you&amp;rsquo;re scared to fly, let me ease your mind
If I&amp;rsquo;m the navigator you&amp;rsquo;ll be alright
we&amp;rsquo;ll find euphoria before sunrise

I like the way you hesitate,
Often lust so prolonged can be the right kind of wrong
For you,
You say you&amp;rsquo;re bound by a circle so you can&amp;rsquo;t acquiesce
You should rely on your senses cause it&amp;rsquo;s senseless distress
To deny what your conscience screams is
A consequent-less trip
Cause no one needs to know

We&amp;rsquo;re all alone, so why just dip your toes?
Why not breathe in deep and dive down?

Let me be the navigator, and I will guide you
I know you&amp;rsquo;re scared to fly, let me ease your mind
If I&amp;rsquo;m the navigator you&amp;rsquo;ll be alright
we&amp;rsquo;ll find euphoria before sunrise

Drip drops that poison thawing from her mind,
Adrift at last, she&amp;rsquo;s swimming in the sky
And all her doubts are far behind
And she falls in love
Her body ebbs in the undulating tide,
Blanketed in stars, she whispers the night
That all I am is all she needs
And she falls in love</description>

LYRICS TO NEW CD<br />
So in an effort to preempt the inevitable bewilderment and resultant bombardment of emails wondering what the hell it is I'm saying in these songs, I have decided to post the lyrics for the new CD. Annunciation has never been one of my strongest suits, so hopefully this will clear up any confusion that can and often does occur whenever I open my mouth to sing. Although it is pretty amusing to hear what people come up with (&quot;far away and long beyond the apple tree&quot;, &quot;you probably wish the bullet had caught my head, but it landed in my butt instead&quot; etc.) I thought you might like to see what I'm actually saying, even if it doesn't sound like it. Anyway, I hope you like them.<br />
<br />
p.s. I don't have the lyrics for &quot;Anything&quot; or &quot;Let Go&quot; on my computer and would feel uncomfortable posting them without first consulting with Brian (the author of those two), but I will see if he wants to post them as well.<br />
<br />
Arson &amp; Alchemy<br />
<br />
I once believed divine decree<br />
But all the years have poisoned me,<br />
With a flagrant apathy<br />
<br />
Oh I never lost control at all,<br />
I just gave into the greatest lie that the world has ever known<br />
<br />
I could&rsquo;ve been so much more than I am<br />
<br />
Well I&rsquo;m still breathing<br />
though not all I was meant to be yet<br />
Can you heal me alchemy?<br />
<br />
Make me a sire of gold<br />
And I&rsquo;ll set fire to the world<br />
Cause I&rsquo;ve got years to burn<br />
before I&rsquo;m gone<br />
<br />
I used to fan the flames but now,<br />
I want to be the wind that blows from the hand that wrote it all<br />
<br />
I&rsquo;ve been first star wishing<br />
For a Midas Affliction<br />
From Chrysopoeiate addiction<br />
But I&rsquo;m still so far off<br />
<br />
I want to be so much more than I am<br />
<br />
Well I&rsquo;m still breathing,<br />
Though not all I was meant to be yet<br />
Can you heal me Alchemy?<br />
<br />
Make me a sire of gold<br />
And I&rsquo;ll set fire to the world<br />
Cause I&rsquo;ve got years to burn<br />
Before I&rsquo;m gone<br />
<br />
Hurricane<br />
<br />
You shimmer like the Northern Star and I&rsquo;m just the guy with the telescope on the ground<br />
You&rsquo;re rushing like a waterfall and I&rsquo;m just the dribbling of a faucet that won&rsquo;t turn off<br />
I got concrete shoes, and you&rsquo;re strapped to rockets,<br />
If it&rsquo;s sink or swim, then I&rsquo;m swiftly drowning<br />
I&rsquo;m on the ocean floor and you&rsquo;re out of the atmosphere<br />
<br />
Why do I not see this coming?<br />
The more I try, the less you&rsquo;re enamored<br />
When it all plays out, well who was I kidding?<br />
To say you&rsquo;re out of my league doesn&rsquo;t start to explain it<br />
I&rsquo;m a drop of rain and baby you&rsquo;re a hurricane<br />
<br />
I whipped out the big guns, aimed to impress,<br />
centered those cross-hairs on your chest<br />
crossed my fingers, pulled the trigger<br />
just hoping for the best<br />
you probably wish the bullet had caught my head<br />
but it landed in my foot instead<br />
<br />
Why do I not see this coming?<br />
The more I try, the less you&rsquo;re enamored<br />
When it all plays out, well who was I kidding?<br />
To say you&rsquo;re out of my league is a kind understatement<br />
I&rsquo;m a drop of rain and baby you&rsquo;re a hurricane<br />
<br />
Those chemicals made synapses fire,<br />
made illogical seem probable<br />
Like a cannon ball, I&rsquo;m bound to soar and fall<br />
I&rsquo;m just a lead balloon, you&rsquo;re anti-gravitational.<br />
And I&rsquo;m out of my head<br />
<br />
Why do I not see this coming?<br />
When the more I try, the less you&rsquo;re enamored<br />
When it all plays out, well who was I kidding?<br />
To say you&rsquo;re out of my league doesn&rsquo;t start to explain it<br />
I&rsquo;m just a drop of rain and baby you&rsquo;re a&hellip;<br />
<br />
But if I had what I want, I&rsquo;d get you off and I&rsquo;d turn you on<br />
And I&rsquo;d have what I need, to bring down a goddess to her knees<br />
I&rsquo;d sell my soul to know, what to give to the girl who&rsquo;s got it all<br />
I&rsquo;d conjure the winds to blow and knock you off of that pedestal<br />
I&rsquo;m calling your bluff, and I bet it all so you better fold<br />
If I don&rsquo;t strike gold, what&rsquo;s left to give when you got it all?<br />
<br />
Ghost<br />
<br />
A single ray of light is dancing in a darkened room<br />
it penetrates an eye close-by, but the black is not removed<br />
the face in which the eye resides is a mix of cloth and stone<br />
a pale linen veil draped over withered bones<br />
<br />
She hovers like a moth over the flame,<br />
But it&rsquo;s not the light she needs, only the heat it brings<br />
And as I watch the powder start to change<br />
I know where seven years have gone to waste<br />
<br />
I would give the world<br />
To go back all those years<br />
And stop you at the start<br />
before you disappeared<br />
<br />
I&rsquo;ll be there for you when I can<br />
just show me there&rsquo;s yet something there<br />
that&rsquo;s still worth fighting for<br />
<br />
The world around her is just spinning like a carousel<br />
All attempts to revert back to normalcy have quickly failed<br />
As her immortality is sizzling on a silver spoon<br />
She&rsquo;ll contemplate the point in space and then create the wound<br />
<br />
I do not know this solemn ghost<br />
It&rsquo;s not the human I recall<br />
her shell&rsquo;s remained the same<br />
But all the hope in her is gone<br />
<br />
I would give the world<br />
To go back all those years<br />
And stop you at the start<br />
before you disappeared<br />
<br />
I&rsquo;ll be there for you when I can<br />
just show me there&rsquo;s yet something there<br />

<br />
save me<br />
save me<br />
save me<br />

save me<br />
and I&rsquo;ll replace the flame<br />

&amp;bull; In 1 day we received orders in our store from Canada, Germany, Brazil, Mississippi, and Kentucky. That&amp;rsquo;s not a typical day but hopefully it will be soon.
&amp;bull; At Alternative Addiction we have been voted #1 in it&amp;rsquo;s Unsigned Top 10 list for January &amp;amp; February (rankings are updated on the 15th of each month). The kicker is that we didn&amp;rsquo;t know anything about this until we were #1!

					<title>Recent Reflections</title>
					<link>http://streamlineworld.com/newsarchive.cfm?feature=43578&amp;postid=20679</link>
					<description>I debated, at great length, whether or not to post this message, and ultimately (obviously) decided to, rationalizing that anyone reading this would be someone taking an active interest in the music I help to create, and as such, an interest in me as an individual.  My apprehensions weren&apos;t a question of whether I thought this was an important or relevant issue, but rather out of fear that in doing so my intentions would be misconstrued.  That being said, I just want to share a few thoughts with you.

It&apos;s always amazed me how influential and impacting art of any kind is on the human race.  It&apos;s probably the single greatest and most important characteristic of our species.  The ability to express thoughts and emotions in creative and meaningful ways is what (among obvious other things) distinguishes us from other life forms on the planet.  The value of these various means of..which are paramount to the well-being and functionality of human beings), is demonstrated by sheer fact that the entertainment business continues to be one of the most prosperous in the world.  I have always had a deep love and appreciation for films, and in fact it was movies that in a round-about way lead me to my true passion, music.   I love the transportational quality of this art form that allows me to escape the insanity of everyday life, if only temporarily.  It&apos;s truly an innate gift to be able to consistently elicit an emotional response from another person by merely pretending.   It&apos;s upsetting to say the least when the world loses someone with this ability, especially when it would seem they had so much more to give.  It&apos;s unfortunate, though undeniable, that tragic circumstances are often required to make a substantial impact, but it&apos;s a fact that trauma works where subtlety fails.   To quote a very relevant work of art, &amp;quot;people need dramatic examples to shake them from apathy&amp;quot;.  Often times, it&apos;s true.  While I try to be conscious of these things constantly, death always forces me to confront certain realities.

There is an adverse affect that modern broadcast news has on people.  The tendency to over saturate an audience with a topic often inadvertently causes sterility.  I do not wish to trivialize the loss many people are feeling by adding to the redundancy of this topic, but it&apos;s something that forced me to once again realize and appreciate the fragility and ephemerality of life.  It seemed especially poignant considering the subject matter I tend to write about, so I thought I&apos;d just say a few words about it.  Anyway, it&apos;s almost 5 in the morning, and I&apos;m stoned from exhaustion, but hopefully this made some bit of sense.  Thanks for reading, feel free to share your thoughts below.

The Band is Finally Complete!

We are happy to announce that after years of searching we have finally found a permanent guitarist.  Brad Ourso hails from Baton Rouge Louisiana and is no stranger to the world of music.  He has performed in various bands since he was 15 and proved to be the perfect fit in every way.  We were fortunate to be able to have Brad contribute to our latest recording and he will be joining us for our shows back on the east coast.  Please help us welcome him to the group by sending him a comment or message on myspace, or by dropping him an email at Brad@streamlineworld.com.

The Search is Over&amp;hellip;Streamline Celebrates New Member

We are pleased to announce that after almost two years of searching, the position of drummer has finally been filled. This week Streamline welcomed veteran musician Brian Ireland (of Something Corporate and William Tell) to the group. Brian, a California native first began his involvement with the band in the summer of 2005 when he was enlisted to play drums on a recording of the newly completed song &amp;lsquo;All I Need&amp;rsquo;. In the year and a half since Brian has remained a mentor and a friend to all of us, and his commitment to the band has been unwavering. We are all very excited and enthusiastic about what the future will bring and are anxious to begin this new chapter of evolution for our band. Thanks again to all of you for listening, and please help us in welcoming Brian to the group.

Drop Brian a line and say hello... brian@streamlineworld.com

New Pics/Video Coming Soon

We will be posting a lot of pictures of Streamline&apos;s new Hollywood home early next week.  So be sure to keep checking back for those.  

8/22/06 
More Updates/New Gig Listing 

Well its been a month since our arrival on the west coast, but we&amp;rsquo;re finally all settled in. We&amp;rsquo;ll be adding some pictures in the next week of our new home in Hollywood, as well as some other clips, so be sure to keep checking back for that. Although our website and myspace page have been somewhat stagnant lately, we are in the process of reviving both with the intention of making each a fully functional means of communication. We will be updating both regularly and doing our very best to keep everyone up to date on the latest happenings. We will also be making a greater effort to reply to all of your emails and comments. We are flattered by your continued support and interest and we promise to be better at responding to your messages. 

At this time we have also posted a new show listing on the gig page. It will be an acoustic set on September 27th at 8:30 p.m. at Highland Ground in Los Angeles. The door charge will be $5. We hope to see you there. In other news, the band has been working on some new material to be recorded in the very near future. We will keep you all posted on the progress of that, so definitely keep checking back for the latest news. In the mean time, we thank you all for your patience and hope you all are well and enjoying these last days of summer.

An Overdue Update

Thank you everyone for your continued support throughout the last few months, we&amp;rsquo;ve been making a lot of changes and have inadvertently neglected to keep you all informed. So here&amp;rsquo;s what&amp;rsquo;s been happening with us the last few weeks.

We decided after seven months of being in NYC that it just wasn&amp;rsquo;t the place for us. We were unsuccessful in finding musicians to complete the group and our creativity level was very low. It just didn&amp;rsquo;t feel like the right environment for us to do what we hoped to get accomplished. So in late April we left the city and moved back to Rochester where we saved up some cash and played a few shows. Now, following in our footsteps from last year, we have once again relocated to Los Angeles. We all feel that being here last year was the turning point for our group professionally and we hope to build upon the work we began a year ago. So for the time being our new home base is LA. We are currently searching for drummers and guitarists in the area and are hoping to get back into the studio to record some new material. We will keep you all posted of our progress and are eager to begin this new chapter in our evolution. As always thanks for listening and for your support.

The Band is Finally Complete!<br />
<br />
We are happy to announce that after years of searching we have finally found a permanent guitarist.  Brad Ourso hails from Baton Rouge Louisiana and is no stranger to the world of music.  He has performed in various bands since he was 15 and proved to be the perfect fit in every way.  We were fortunate to be able to have Brad contribute to our latest recording and he will be joining us for our shows back on the east coast.  Please help us welcome him to the group by sending him a comment or message on myspace, or by dropping him an email at Brad@streamlineworld.com. <br />
<br />

The Search is Over&hellip;Streamline Celebrates New Member<br />
<br />
We are pleased to announce that after almost two years of searching, the position of drummer has finally been filled. This week Streamline welcomed veteran musician Brian Ireland (of Something Corporate and William Tell) to the group. Brian, a California native first began his involvement with the band in the summer of 2005 when he was enlisted to play drums on a recording of the newly completed song &lsquo;All I Need&rsquo;. In the year and a half since Brian has remained a mentor and a friend to all of us, and his commitment to the band has been unwavering. We are all very excited and enthusiastic about what the future will bring and are anxious to begin this new chapter of evolution for our band. Thanks again to all of you for listening, and please help us in welcoming Brian to the group.<br />
<br />
Drop Brian a line and say hello... brian@streamlineworld.com<br />
<br />

New Pics/Video Coming Soon<br />

We will be posting a lot of pictures of Streamline's new Hollywood home early next week.  So be sure to keep checking back for those.  <br />
<br />

More Updates/New Gig Listing <br />
<br />
Well its been a month since our arrival on the west coast, but we&rsquo;re finally all settled in. We&rsquo;ll be adding some pictures in the next week of our new home in Hollywood, as well as some other clips, so be sure to keep checking back for that. Although our website and myspace page have been somewhat stagnant lately, we are in the process of reviving both with the intention of making each a fully functional means of communication. We will be updating both regularly and doing our very best to keep everyone up to date on the latest happenings. We will also be making a greater effort to reply to all of your emails and comments. We are flattered by your continued support and interest and we promise to be better at responding to your messages. <br />
<br />
At this time we have also posted a new show listing on the gig page. It will be an acoustic set on September 27th at 8:30 p.m. at Highland Ground in Los Angeles. The door charge will be $5. We hope to see you there. In other news, the band has been working on some new material to be recorded in the very near future. We will keep you all posted on the progress of that, so definitely keep checking back for the latest news. In the mean time, we thank you all for your patience and hope you all are well and enjoying these last days of summer. <br />

An Overdue Update<br />
<br />
Thank you everyone for your continued support throughout the last few months, we&rsquo;ve been making a lot of changes and have inadvertently neglected to keep you all informed. So here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s been happening with us the last few weeks.<br />
<br />
We decided after seven months of being in NYC that it just wasn&rsquo;t the place for us. We were unsuccessful in finding musicians to complete the group and our creativity level was very low. It just didn&rsquo;t feel like the right environment for us to do what we hoped to get accomplished. So in late April we left the city and moved back to Rochester where we saved up some cash and played a few shows. Now, following in our footsteps from last year, we have once again relocated to Los Angeles. We all feel that being here last year was the turning point for our group professionally and we hope to build upon the work we began a year ago. So for the time being our new home base is LA. We are currently searching for drummers and guitarists in the area and are hoping to get back into the studio to record some new material. We will keep you all posted of our progress and are eager to begin this new chapter in our evolution. As always thanks for listening and for your support. <br />

Living The Dream? 
Hello Everyone!

Our tour is well under way, and if you have been out to see us, THANK YOU! We have had a wonderful time, and it seems that the word is starting to spread! This has been very encouraging for us, and we appreciate you all. In comparison to our last tour, we have had better turn-outs, more excitement and support than ever! I must note though, that these gratifying moments have come at a high cost. If you have been to any of the shows, you may have heard some of the stories.

It all started out when we got in the van the night of Tuesday, October 16th. With high hopes and fresh showers, we began our journey. By morning Brad was at the end of a drive shift, and was SO zealous, in fact, that he neglected to pay attention to the gas gauge. He will claim it is the gas gauge&apos;s fault, but either way, we ended up on the side of the road in Utah at about 9 a.m. Scholl (Jon) began the effort of a &amp;quot;morning run&amp;quot; to the gas station, but we had no idea how far away it was, so we figured it wouldn&apos;t be the best idea to send our little Jon Scholl out into the great wide open equipped with nothing more than running shoes, 6 bucks, and a gas can. I took the gas can, put my thumb out as visibly as I could, and before I knew it, I was on the edge of the passenger seat in a Big Rig driven by a sketchy (at best) guy named Scotty. We continued to the gas station. I looked through his &amp;quot;Truck Stops&amp;quot; book to find that the next gas station heading East was 12 miles away. Glad we didn&apos;t let Scholl go on that &amp;quot;morning run,&amp;quot; I arrived at the station, hitched a ride back with a nice man in a cargo van, and we were on our way!

We went back West (our destination was East) to get gas because our atlas showed an exit with a town about 3 miles back. As we arrived at a mom and pop gas station, we found a hand written sign on the pump which read &amp;quot;Sorry, no gas for a while.&amp;quot; Our only option was go East, which was now about 15 or 16 miles the other way! As luck (or our gas tank...whichever you believe in) would have it, we ran out of gas AGAIN about a mile beyond where we originally ran out! Wasting no time, I proceeded to hitchhike for the third time of the day. I got another two gallons, and the nice man who picked me up actually brought me back too. We made it to the station, and I proceeded to the counter for the third time in one hour, only this time to fill our tank, not our gas can.

Back on the road, proud of how punctually we solved our dilemma, we continued on with confidence that the worst was behind us. As we got into the Rocky mountains, we quickly realized our confidence was false. The Rocky Mountains are a force to be reckoned with!!!

Lesson learned; Passing through Vail, Co. at dark during a freak snow storm is not a good scenario for a bunch of scrubby band guys with a van and trailer!

We got completely stuck at the bottom of an 8 mile incline, and had to get a tow up the mountain. Eight miles, and 175 USD later, we were told that they had the road on the way down well managed, and that we would have no problem getting down the mountain. All LIES!! Soon we found ourselves spinning out of control into a full jackknife, facing oncoming traffic!! As we stopped, and stole a second to assess the situation only to find that there was an 18 Wheeler headed right for us! Our hands went immediately to the door handles. As we readied ourselves to jump ship, the huge truck missed us by inches! We got out of the jackknife, and crept down the mountain. We had another incline, and Tank and I were FREAKING OUT the whole time. Everyone was pretty edgy as Mike drove, and we climbed our way up. Eventually, we made our way down the mountain at about 5 miles per hour, and I think Tank and I lost years off of our life because we were so nervous!

Continuing with hopes of making it to our first show on time, we got into Indiana just in time for a tornado warning, gale force winds, and a torrential downpour. Despite all of the factors stifling our progress, we made it on time! We got out of the van, stretched our legs after our 40 hour trip, and began to unload in some of the heaviest rain any of us have ever seen. 

The tour continued with success, and luck was on our side all the way through New York City. This is where our short luck decided to take a completely different direction. The story I am about to tell, friends, is what I would call the &amp;quot;Grand Finale!&amp;quot; It goes a little something like this...

After a very trying day in Brooklyn and Queens, we were informed by Scholl that we had a flat tire. Mike and I figured we could fix it with little trouble. With teamwork, we &amp;quot;fixed&amp;quot; the tire. Mike upheld every end of his portion of the project and so did I...with one exception. I did not tighten the lug nuts on the tire!!!

Brad and Tank had gone back to Rochester with Tank&apos;s family, and were safe at home watching the first game of the World Series. Scholl, Mike and Myself got into the van, unwise to the fate that lied ahead. As we got onto the George Washington Bridge, our poor van began to convulse as we bounced wildly inside.&amp;nbsp; We looked outside to see the problem, and saw sparks everywhere!! Scholl immediately stopped in the middle of traffic (not that he could have gone anywhere even if he wanted to). Hastily, Mike and I got out and ran for the elusive tire! We retrieved the tire, and made a futile attempt at putting the tire back on while Scholl called the necessary authorities. We soon realized our van was irreparable at the moment, and it would need to be towed. The problem now was the trailer. We couldn&apos;t tow the two together. Ultimately, we needed a two tow trucks accompanied be their Port Authority personnel, (one flat bed for the trailer) and a couple trained officers of the law to control traffic. By &amp;quot;control&amp;quot; traffic, I mean &amp;quot;stop.&amp;quot; It was a Sunday afternoon, and we completely closed the westbound side of the George Washington Bridge for about an hour! We got towed to separate parking lots by the Port Authority. We were over a mile away from each other and were left with nothing but a consoling pat on the back and a phone number for a guy named George, who apparently owned a tow truck. I figured I&apos;d give him a ring.

George showed up in about fifteen minutes with his truck, his sidekick, a thick accent and some bad gas, which he clearly felt no embarrassment releasing in front of strangers. Despite the gas, he was very helpful. He called a friend, who owned a repair shop close by, and towed the van over. We later went to get the trailer with a truck from the repair shop. I negotiated a final price for the repair that night (which was later changed to a price that totaled three times the agreement) and we checked into a roach motel and got some sleep. They couldn&apos;t get the parts that night, but promised to get them in the morning to have the van ready by 1:00 p.m. the next day.

We rose the next morning to find that they had, in fact, gotten the parts and began work on our humbled vehicle. The time they promised to have it ready was pushed back about two hours, and the price changed to a thousand dollars more than they said it would be, but we eventually settled somewhere in between. They had to replace the axle, the rear driver break system, and all the bits and pieces that go with that. All in all they were very nice, and seemingly honest guys. Tattered and torn, we climbed into the van. Almost exactly 24 hours after the event, we were on the road to our next show, and amazingly, we were on schedule to be there for load-in.

Despite these horrible/wonderful/interesting/crazy/unnerving stories, we have had a very successful tour. We have smiles on our faces, and we have met an array of new friends, and lots of extraordinary and interesting people. Through all of our trials, we had the help of wonderful people throughout, and we would have never survived without them. Whether it is our listeners/fans, friends, family, city authority, or just the passer-by with a big heart, we appreciate the kindness very much, and can thank you for any of the success that we have had. I will sincerely say, after touring for about 6 or 7 years, I have put any of my past road stories under the table in just one week. We thank you all so very much for your support, and cannot wait for the future of this band.
