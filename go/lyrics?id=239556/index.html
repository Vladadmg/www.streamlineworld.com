		<h1>All I Need</h1>
		<p>All I Need<br />©2007, Michael T. Hogan<br /> <br />Twenty years running, I’m hopelessly caught in this maze<br />Well I dart around corners through corridors that all look the same<br />I’m revived by the sound of your voice as you whisper my name<br />With each step that I take I more fervently taste my escape<br /><br />I can feel it like it’s pouring through my veins<br />I give all that I have<br />Cause I’m hoping this maze will unfold<br />Right at your door, baby<br /><br />And when I get home you’re all that I need<br />And when I grow old you’re all that I need<br />Azraline, my queen<br /><br />I spent twenty years floating and I’m hopelessly stranded at sea<br />Well I’m searching for green in this fusion of blue around me<br />I steer for the horizon at the corner of the world<br />Where the advent of a zephyr and the swelling of a purl<br />Let me know I’m close<br /><br />I can feel it like it’s pouring through my veins<br />I give all that I have<br />Cause I’m hoping this breeze carries me<br />Onto your shore, baby<br /><br />And when I get home you’re all that I need<br />And when I grow old you’re all that I need<br />I know it’s a long way<br />But I’ll get there someday<br />And when I get home you’re all that I need<br />Azraline<br /><br />And I know there’s a thousand miles dividing us<br />And no, I won’t – till I’m standing in your door – give up and<br />I know it won’t be long<br />Now that I found out where to go<br />I don’t need much<br />I don’t need much<br />Just open up and let me in<br /><br />And when I get home you’re all that I need<br />And when I grow you’re all that I need<br />Oh it’s a long way<br />But I’ll get there someday<br />And when I get home you will be all I need<br />You’ll be all I need<br />Azraline, my queen</p>
