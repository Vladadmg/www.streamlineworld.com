		<p>Arson & Alchemy<br />©2009, Michael T. Hogan & Brad Ourso<br /><br />I once believed divine decree<br />But all the years have poisoned me, <br />With a flagrant apathy<br /><br />Oh I never lost control at all, <br />I just gave into the greatest lie that the world has ever known<br /><br />I could’ve been so much more than I am<br /><br />Well I’m still breathing<br />though not all I was meant to be yet<br />Can you heal me alchemy?<br /><br />Make me a sire of gold<br />And I’ll set fire to the world<br />Cause I’ve got years to burn <br />before I’m gone<br /><br />I used to fan the flames but now, <br />I want to be the wind that blows from the hand that wrote it all<br /><br />I’ve been first star wishing<br />For a Midas Affliction<br />From Chrysopoeiate addiction<br />But I’m still so far off<br /><br />I want to be so much more than I am<br /><br />Well I’m still breathing,<br />Though not all I was meant to be yet<br />Can you heal me Alchemy?<br /><br />Make me a sire of gold<br />And I’ll set fire to the world<br />Cause I’ve got years to burn <br />Before I’m gone</p>
