		<p>Ghost<br />©2005, Michael T. Hogan<br /><br />A single ray of light is dancing in a darkened room<br />it penetrates an eye close-by, but the black is not removed<br />the face in which the eye resides is a mix of cloth and stone<br />a pale linen veil draped over withered bones<br /><br />She hovers like a moth over the flame, <br />But it’s not the light she needs, only the heat it brings<br />And as I watch the powder start to change <br />I know where seven years have gone to waste<br /><br />I would give the world <br />To go back all those years<br />And stop you at the start<br />before you disappeared <br /><br />I’ll be there for you when I can<br />just show me there’s yet something there<br />that’s still worth fighting for<br /><br />The world around her is just spinning like a carousel<br />All attempts to revert back to normalcy have quickly failed<br />As her immortality is sizzling on a silver spoon<br />She’ll contemplate the point in space and then create the wound<br /><br />I do not know this solemn ghost <br />It’s not the human I recall<br />her shell’s remained the same<br />But all the hope in her is gone <br /><br />I would give the world <br />To go back all those years<br />And stop you at the start<br />before you disappeared <br /><br />I’ll be there for you when I can<br />just show me there’s yet something there<br />that’s still worth fighting for<br /><br />save me<br />save me<br />save me<br />come on say<br />save me <br />save me <br />save me<br />and I’ll replace the flame<br /><br />my little ray of light is dancing in a cloud she made<br />I wish she’d come back down where it is safe<br />And stay</p>
