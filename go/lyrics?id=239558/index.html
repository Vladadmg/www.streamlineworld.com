		<p>Flicker<br />©2004, Michael T. Hogan<br /> <br />Stop right there,<br />The part where you say <br />That you don’t care<br />And then you start to cry<br /> <br />It’s okay<br />I understand your pain<br />Though you’re sure there’s no way<br />I swear there’ll be better days<br /> <br />And she is flickering again<br />And I can’t save this flame<br />If it flickers out again<br /> <br />Promise me<br />You won’t keep <br />Crying yourself to sleep at night<br />And cursing your life<br /> <br />It’s alright <br />You’ll be fine<br />Take a deep breath<br />Baby please try<br /> <br />And she is flickering again<br />And I can’t save this flame<br />If it flickers out again<br /> <br />Stay, when everything around you starts to change<br />And everyone you know begins to fade<br />Oh god, I’ve never seen you so sad, <br />I’ve never seen you so sad<br />I’ve never seen you this way<br />Please don’t change<br />Please don’t fade<br />Please don’t let this tear you down so far <br />You can’t find your way back from where you came<br />Please don’t fade<br />Please don’t break<br />Please don’t let this tear you down so far<br />That you can’t find your way back from where you came.</p>
