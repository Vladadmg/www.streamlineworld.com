		<h1>Navigator</h1>
		<p>Navigator<br />©2005, Michael T. Hogan<br /> <br />I like the way you look tonight<br />Wearing only moonlight<br />You sparked a fire<br />And I am smoldering<br />You feign indifference darling, <br />But I feel you trembling<br />You’re trying so hard <br />To not be physical<br />Why even fight it child,<br />When it’s this natural?<br /><br />When we’re all alone and no one needs to know<br />Without a single light on<br /><br />Let me be the navigator, and I will guide you<br />I know you’re scared to fly, let me ease your mind<br />If I’m the navigator you’ll be alright<br />we’ll find euphoria before sunrise <br /><br />I like the way you hesitate, <br />Often lust so prolonged can be the right kind of wrong<br />For you,<br />You say you’re bound by a circle so you can’t acquiesce<br />You should rely on your senses cause it’s senseless distress <br />To deny what your conscience screams is<br />A consequent-less trip<br />Cause no one needs to know<br /><br />We’re all alone, so why just dip your toes?<br />Why not breathe in deep and dive down?<br /><br />Let me be the navigator, and I will guide you<br />I know you’re scared to fly, let me ease your mind<br />If I’m the navigator you’ll be alright<br />we’ll find euphoria before sunrise<br /><br />Drip drops that poison thawing from her mind,<br />Adrift at last, she’s swimming in the sky<br />And all her doubts are far behind <br />And she falls in love<br />Her body ebbs in the undulating tide,<br />Blanketed in stars, she whispers the night<br />That all I am is all she needs<br />And she falls in love</p>
