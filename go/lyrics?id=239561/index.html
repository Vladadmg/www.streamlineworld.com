		<p>The Untitled<br />©2004, Michael T. Hogan<br /> <br />Welcome to a world of endless lies<br />If you’re old enough to breath here<br />You’re not too young to die<br />Welcome to a place where time flies<br />You might wake up one day and find<br />Your whole life has passed you by<br /> <br />And you’re screaming like it mattered<br />And all that you want is someone<br />Screaming like they’ll hear you<br />But it’s pointless<br />Won’t you let me live for myself<br /> <br />Welcome to a world of endless lies<br />If you’re bold enough to dream here<br />You’re much more apt to cry<br />I used to see the world through your eyes<br />Then I opened up mine<br />Took a breath and realized<br />My whole life might pass by <br />And I never got to be me<br /> <br />Now I’m screaming like it mattered<br />And all that I want is you gone<br />Screaming like you’ll hear me <br />But it’s pointless<br />Won’t you let me live for myself<br /> <br />Life is too damn short<br />Don’t let it get away<br />Only you create your identity <br />Mirrors can be changed <br />No matter what they say<br />If the eyes you view them with examine differently<br />Life is one big game we’re fortunate to play<br /> <br />Don’t let it get away</p>
