		<p>The Meaning of Life<br />©2004, Michael T. Hogan<br /> <br />I met an old man today<br />Standing on the street<br />Wearing a sign that read:<br />“This is my last day alive”<br />So I stopped to ask<br />If in his long life,<br />There was anything that he regretted<br /> <br />And he spoke to me words I will never forget…<br /> <br />He said,<br /> <br />“I’ve lived my whole life<br />knowing one day I’ll die, <br />and that it’s alright, oh but it’s alright<br />And if you are wise, <br />You’ll take my advice<br />And you’ll do alright <br />Yes you’ll turn out fine”<br /> <br />Oh, he said “life is just a phase <br />You can only get out what’s put in<br />And it’s over in a blink <br />So why not give everything<br />Boy are you listening?<br />It won’t be repeated man, <br />And this is the meaning of life”<br /> <br />Saw an old friend today<br />Standing in the rain<br />Wearing a ring that she did not have the last time we met<br />So, out of concern I <br />Stopped to ask her why<br />She’d betrayed solitude<br />Her attribute I’d most admired<br />Then she spoke to me words I will never forget,<br /> <br />She said,<br />  <br />“I’ve lived my whole life<br />hoping one day I’d find<br />something beautiful that I could both share and call mine<br />and if you’re as blessed as I<br />one day you will find<br />Cyclicality between souls is what makes you whole<br /> <br />And falling in love is like an eclipse,<br />For it only occurs once or twice<br />And you could miss it if you blink, <br />So why not embrace it when you become faced with it<br />It’s so amazing man,<br />And this is the meaning of life”</p>
