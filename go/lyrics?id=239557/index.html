		<p>Higher<br />©2007, Michael T. Hogan<br /> <br />‘Open wide, and stay open wide<br />it’s a blue-streak, life<br />but live as if you’ll never die’<br /><br />whether wrong or right<br />it’s an axiom I can’t deny<br />and I’m beginning to like<br />the thrill and perils of learning to fly<br /><br />some moments are over way too fast, <br />and I get swept away with them every time<br />I close my eyes and I get<br /><br />Higher and higher to the borders of Elysium<br />Higher and higher <br />Higher and higher to the borders of Elysium<br />Higher and higher<br /><br />Morning light <br />Hits like a dagger in a waking eye<br />But at least I’m alive,<br />With her asleep at my side<br /><br />Then she smiles and sighs,<br />And I’m swimming in her opening eyes,<br />It’s a rising tide that I’m content to drown in<br />To drown inside<br /><br />These moments are over way too fast, <br />and I get swept away with them every time,<br />I close my eyes and I get<br /><br />Higher and higher to the borders of Elysium<br />Higher and higher<br />Higher and higher to the borders of Elysium<br />Higher and higher<br /><br />I wanna be far away and long beyond the apogee<br />I wanna feel air without the hindrance of gravity<br />I want me to stall, and be out of control<br />I’m fearless to fall, cause I know it won’t be long<br />before I’m thrown<br /><br />Higher and higher<br /><br />And love, love is a catapult<br />Your love, your love is a catapult<br />Your love, your love is<br /><br />Higher and higher<br />To the borders of Elysium<br />Higher and higher</p>
