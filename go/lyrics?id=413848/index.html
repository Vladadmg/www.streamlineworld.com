		<h1>Thick and Thin</h1>
		<p>Thick and Thin<br />©2008, Michael T. Hogan<br /> <br />In the glow of a street light,<br />when the night cloaks her shame,<br />she looks for love and the comfort of a hollow embrace<br />And though it offers her gold, and brief escape from the cold<br />She’s after something much more than simply warming her bones<br /><br />She says, “a few lays, alleviate the sharp pangs of hunger,<br />But a heartbeat’s still all I have”<br /><br />And she says, “I want someone to love me just the way I am, just the way I am”<br />She says, “I want someone beside me whether lose or win, through thick and thin”<br /><br />In the blaze of the limelight<br />To unanimous pride<br />She outshines every diamond in a starlet’s sky<br />But she’s shrouded in darkness like a waning moon<br />she knows there’s much more to her than is seen by the world<br /><br />She says, “I can’t find peace of mind when nobody knows me<br />And a heartthrob is all I am”<br /><br />And she says,  “I want someone to love me just the way I am, just the way I am”<br />She says,  “I want someone beside me whether lose or win, oh through thick and thin”<br /><br />“When the light fades to night brings the cold rain and thunder<br />When a desert sun, is burning up every drop of hope there under<br />Be an anchor in an ocean of change”<br />And she says,  “I want someone to love me just the way I am, just the way I am”<br /><br />“Say to me, come on and say to me<br />Say you’ll love me just the way I am, just the way I am<br />Stay beside me whether lose or win oh through thick and thin”</p>
