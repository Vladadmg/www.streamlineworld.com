		<h1>The Only Thing That Matters</h1>
		<p>The Only Thing That Matters<br />©2004, Michael T. Hogan<br /><br />I watched as you rushed out the door and into the rain<br />Leaving crowded conversation, lacking comfort therein<br />And fearing you’d succumb to grief and be swept away<br />I followed in your footsteps and trailed in your wake<br /><br />So you’d know, you’re not alone<br /><br />Then you fell into my arms and cried out between sobs<br />You said ‘why did this have to happen?’ and ‘why couldn’t it be stopped?’<br />And staring through the darkness and into your face I said,<br />‘my dear there are some things that no one can change’<br /><br />But know you’re not alone<br />just know that you’re not alone<br /><br />when everything around you begins to tumble down<br />and the world starts tasting sour, as surely it is bound to  <br />I know it isn’t easy but don’t you give up on me <br />Always remember this, cause it’s the only thing that matters at all…<br /><br />No one said it’s easy<br />Letting go, accepting<br />When you’re hoping that it might change <br />And clinging to the memories<br /><br />You say, ‘I’m not a strong girl, and it’s alright,<br />But I don’t think that I take this much more<br />I say, ‘I feel the same way, but it’s alright<br />Just stay here in my arms and <br />Just tell me you know<br /><br /> you’re not alone<br />just know that you’re not alone<br />you must know<br />you’ll never be alone<br /><br />when everything around you begins to tumble down<br />and the world starts tasting sour, as surely it is bound to  <br />I know it isn’t easy but please don’t give up on me <br />There’s just one thing you must do, but it’s the only thing that matters at all…<br /><br />Hold on <br /><br />Hold your breath and look out the window<br />Know the clouds won’t hang forever<br />seasons always change, eventually<br />as tortured thoughts scream out like a banshee<br />drain your hope and tear at your valor <br />think of what I said and promise me <br />you’ll hold on… <br /><br />Breathe again with eyes out the window,<br />watch the clouds start to dissolve <br />replacing grief with a thousand memories<br />feel it coming back again <br />forcing all the wounds to mend<br />and patching all the holes punched in your life,<br />and making it alright<br /><br />when everything around you begins to tumble down<br />and the world starts tasting sour, as surely it is bound to  <br />I know it isn’t easy but don’t you give up on me <br />Always remember this, cause it’s the only thing that matters at all…<br /><br />And know you’re not alone…<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Unsed lyrics<br /><br /> <br />And don’t look back once you arrive there <br />escape to places viewed in a dream<br /><br /><br />And if you need a friend through it all, I’m only a few steps away<br />And if you need a shoulder to lean on look no farther than me<br />I would give the world to you dear if you would only ask for the key<br />I would paint a landscape around you fit for a queen <br /><br />Drowning in an ocean <br />Caught under the flood<br />And praying for a savior <br />To wake you from this nightmare</p>
