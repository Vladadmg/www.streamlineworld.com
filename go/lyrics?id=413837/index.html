		<p>Hurricane<br />©2008, Michael T. Hogan<br /><br />You shimmer like the Northern Star and I’m just the guy with the telescope on the ground<br />You’re rushing like a waterfall and I’m just the dribbling of a faucet that won’t turn off<br />I got concrete shoes, and you’re strapped to rockets,<br />If it’s sink or swim, then I’m swiftly drowning<br />I’m on the ocean floor and you’re out of the atmosphere<br /><br />Why do I not see this coming?<br />The more I try, the less you’re enamored<br />When it all plays out, well who was I kidding?<br />To say you’re out of my league doesn’t start to explain it<br />I’m a drop of rain and baby you’re a hurricane<br /><br />I whipped out the big guns, aimed to impress,<br />centered those cross-hairs on your chest<br />crossed my fingers, pulled the trigger<br />just hoping for the best<br />you probably wish the bullet had caught my head<br />but it landed in my foot instead<br /><br />Why do I not see this coming?<br />The more I try, the less you’re enamored<br />When it all plays out, well who was I kidding?<br />To say you’re out of my league is a kind understatement<br />I’m a drop of rain and baby you’re a hurricane<br /><br />Those chemicals made synapses fire,<br />made illogical seem probable<br />Like a cannon ball, I’m bound to soar and fall<br />I’m just a lead balloon, you’re anti-gravitational.<br />And I’m out of my head<br /><br />Why do I not see this coming?<br />When the more I try, the less you’re enamored<br />When it all plays out, well who was I kidding?<br />To say you’re out of my league doesn’t start to explain it<br />I’m just a drop of rain and baby you’re a…<br /><br />But if I had what I want, I’d get you off and I’d turn you on<br />And I’d have what I need, to bring down a goddess to her knees<br />I’d sell my soul to know, what to give to the girl who’s got it all<br />I’d conjure the winds to blow and knock you off of that pedestal<br />I’m calling your bluff, and I bet it all so you better fold<br />If I don’t strike gold, what’s left to give when you got it all?</p>
